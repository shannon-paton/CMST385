				"All that is gold does not glitter,<br>
				Not all those who wander are lost;<br>
				The old that is strong does not wither,<br>
				Deep roots are not reached by the frost.<br><br>

				From the ashes a fire shall be woken,<br>
				A light from the shadows shall spring;<br>
				Renewed shall be blade that was broken,<br>
				The crownless again shall be king."<br>
