				<h3>Closed Tuesday, May 18th</h3>

				<p> Sorry for the inconvenience but we're following the excellent example of teachers and taking a "cafe proprietor's work day". There's a mountain of paperwork and exciting plans afoot!<br>

				S: If I haven't mentioned it recently, we really appreciate your support - especially during this most difficult year. We do it for you and couldn't do it without you! </p>
